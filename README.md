# ROS

http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/NavigatingTheFilesystem

Ros = middleware for robotics
There are 4 primary parts of how ROS works:
1. Nodes = a single program that perfomrs a single task (differnt machines using the same node can communicate with each other)
Nodes have: a type and unique name
2. Parameters = global/local 
3. Messages = default way a node communicates. 
topics = name + message type
each topic has a list of publishers/subscribers
there exists a master that connects nodes together
4. Services = remove procedure calls generated by the node
