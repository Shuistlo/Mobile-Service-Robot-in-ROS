# A Mobile Service Robot programmed in ROS that can perform Visitor Escorts

This project seeks to program a Mobile Service Robot in ROS capable of escorting a visitor to a specified room in Bush House. 
Please see the instructions.pdf file for how to run this code. Below are some videos of the robot in action:

**Hardware**

A video of the Turtlebot from start up. Footage depicts the initial robot localization spin and the Turtlebot going to a lobby goal and a north wing goal on the 7th floor. [Available Here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/P4G1C8FnU3J2HEBD8)

A video of the Turtlebot performing an escort to 701N from the 7th floor lobby.

**Simulation**

A video demonstrating the Turtlebot's recovery behaviors. [Available Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lRcLoFVqHVx-3HIlyh5Z9rHq4S1ws0wm/view?usp=sharing)

A video demonstrating the Turtlebot's behaviour upon failing to complete an instruction. Failure is simulated in this demonstration by lowering the actionTime to 3 seconds and therefore only allowing the Turtlebot 3 seconds to reach a goal.
